- AssetReturns: Contains annualized returns for various assets.
- MarketCrashData: Contains returns for various assets during market crashes.
- AssetAllocation: Contains asset allocation percentages for different strategies.

## **Visualizations**
- Strategy Returns vs Asset Returns: Bar plot comparing the annualized returns of different strategies and assets.
- Annualized Market Returns during Crashes per Strategy: Bar plot showing the performance of different strategies during market crashes.

## **Conclusion**
- The data reveals the performance differences between various strategies and assets.
- The visualizations help identify which strategies are more resilient during market downturns.
